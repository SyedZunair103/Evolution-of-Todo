# The Evolution of Todo Constitution

## Core Principles

### Strict Spec-Driven Development Only
Every line of code in every phase must be 100% generated by Claude Code based on written specifications. If generated code contains bugs, missing features, or violates any rule → refine the specification → ask Claude to regenerate. Manual edits or patches are strictly forbidden.

### No Direct Human Code Editing
Files may only be created, modified or refactored through Claude Code function calls / edits. Humans are only allowed to write, improve and iterate on Markdown specifications, plans, prompts, and CLAUDE.md instructions — never touch source code directly.

### Iterative Spec Refinement Process
Required workflow for every feature / phase: 1. Write clear, detailed specification 2. Ask Claude to generate implementation plan + task breakdown 3. Implement step-by-step via Claude Code 4. Test → report issues → refine spec → regenerate affected parts. Judges will heavily evaluate: Number and quality of spec iterations, CLAUDE.md prompt history, Transparency of the refinement process.

### Clean Code & Architecture Principles (Mandatory Across All Phases)
Strictly follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb/Standard for JS/TS, etc.). Use type hints / TypeScript everywhere possible. Write docstrings / JSDoc on public functions, classes and modules. Use meaningful names, small functions, single responsibility principle. Proper exception handling with clear user-facing messages. Strong input validation and security practices. Zero hard-coded secrets / credentials.

### Phase & Feature Coverage Rules
Must implement all phases in order: Phase I: Basic 5 CRUD features (in-memory Python console), Phase II: Full-stack web + auth (Next.js + FastAPI + Neon + JWT), Phase III: AI-powered conversational chatbot (OpenAI Agents SDK / ChatKit / MCP SDK), Phase IV: Local Kubernetes deployment (Docker, Minikube, Helm, AIOps tools), Phase V: Advanced cloud-native (Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean DOKS, event-driven). Bonus goals (strongly recommended): Reusable Intelligence via Claude sub-agents & agent skills, Cloud-Native Blueprints for spec-driven deployment, Multi-language support (Urdu in chatbot), Voice command input.

### Recommended Monorepo Structure
Maintain proper project organization with specs/, src/, frontend/, backend/, k8s/ directories as outlined in the structure requirements. Each phase evolves the structure appropriately while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

## Supreme Governing Rules (Must Never Be Violated)

This constitution is the highest authority for the entire project.

1. **Strict Spec-Driven Development Only**
   - NO manual code writing is permitted under any circumstances.
   - Every line of code in every phase must be 100% generated by Claude Code based on written specifications.
   - If generated code contains bugs, missing features, or violates any rule → refine the specification → ask Claude to regenerate. Manual edits or patches are strictly forbidden.

2. **No Direct Human Code Editing**
   - Files may only be created, modified or refactored through Claude Code function calls / edits.
   - Humans are only allowed to write, improve and iterate on Markdown specifications, plans, prompts, and CLAUDE.md instructions — never touch source code directly.

3. **Iterative Spec Refinement Process**
   Required workflow for every feature / phase:
   1. Write clear, detailed specification
   2. Ask Claude to generate implementation plan + task breakdown
   3. Implement step-by-step via Claude Code
   4. Test → report issues → refine spec → regenerate affected parts
   Judges will heavily evaluate:
   - Number and quality of spec iterations
   - CLAUDE.md prompt history
   - Transparency of the refinement process

4. **Clean Code & Architecture Principles (Mandatory Across All Phases)**
   - Strictly follow language-specific style guides (PEP 8 for Python, Airbnb/Standard for JS/TS, etc.)
   - Use type hints / TypeScript everywhere possible
   - Write docstrings / JSDoc on public functions, classes and modules
   - Use meaningful names, small functions, single responsibility principle
   - Proper exception handling with clear user-facing messages
   - Strong input validation and security practices
   - Zero hard-coded secrets / credentials

5. **Recommended Monorepo Structure (Evolves Across Phases)**

6. **Phase & Feature Coverage Rules**
Must implement **all** phases in order:
- Phase I: Basic 5 CRUD features (in-memory Python console)
- Phase II: Full-stack web + auth (Next.js + FastAPI + Neon + JWT)
- Phase III: AI-powered conversational chatbot (OpenAI Agents SDK / ChatKit / MCP SDK)
- Phase IV: Local Kubernetes deployment (Docker, Minikube, Helm, AIOps tools)
- Phase V: Advanced cloud-native (Kafka, Dapr, DigitalOcean DOKS, event-driven)

Bonus goals (strongly recommended):
- Reusable Intelligence via Claude sub-agents & agent skills
- Cloud-Native Blueprints for spec-driven deployment
- Multi-language support (Urdu in chatbot)
- Voice command input

7. **Judging & Deliverable Focus**
- Full commit history must show spec-driven process (specs folder + CLAUDE.md critical)
- No commits containing hand-written code
- Each phase submission needs: GitHub link, deployed URL (Vercel when applicable),
- Process quality and thoughtful iterations matter more than pixel-perfect code

## Global Technology Summary

- Python: 3.13+ (uv for dependency & project management)
- Frontend: Next.js 16+ (App Router)
- Backend: FastAPI + SQLModel
- Database: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
- Auth: Better Auth + JWT tokens
- AI Agent: OpenAI Agents SDK, ChatKit, Official MCP SDK
- Container/Orchestration: Docker, Minikube, Helm, DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS)
- Eventing: Kafka + Dapr (Phase V)
- Spec-Driven Tools: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus

## Governance

All development must follow the strict spec-driven development process. No manual code changes are allowed. Every modification must come through refined specifications. The constitution serves as the highest authority for the project, superseding any other practices or guidelines. Amendments require proper documentation and approval through the established process.
